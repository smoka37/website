					<h1>Mercedes-Benz G-Class</h1>
					<p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes called the G-Wagen is a four-wheel drive automobile manufactured based in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line.

The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials - one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature.

Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 43 years. Mercedes-Benz launched a technically new second generation, still with only minor design changes.

The 400,000th unit was built on 4 December 2020. </p>
